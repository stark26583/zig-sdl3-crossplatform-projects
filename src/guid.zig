/// If the device is detached and then re-attached to a different port, or if the base system is rebooted, the device should still report the same GUID.
///
/// GUIDs are as precise as possible but are not guaranteed to distinguish physically distinct but equivalent devices.
/// For example, two game controllers from the same vendor with the same product ID and revision may have the same GUID.

/// This struct is available since SDL 3.2.0.
