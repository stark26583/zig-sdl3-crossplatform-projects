/// ## Function Parameters

/// * `timestamp`: The associated time at which this mouse motion event was received.
/// * `window`: The associated window to which this mouse motion event was addressed.
/// * `id`: The associated mouse from which this mouse motion event was emitted.
/// * `x`: Pointer to a variable that will be treated as the resulting x-axis motion.
/// * `y`: Pointer to a variable that will be treated as the resulting y-axis motion.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// This is called during SDL's handling of platform mouse events to scale the values of the resulting motion delta.

/// It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods of time, such as the entire time your app is running.
/// For that, you should probably use `mouse.setWindowRelativeMode()` or `mouse.setWindowGrab()`, depending on your goals.

// /// * `callback`: A callback used to transform relative mouse motion, or `null` for default behavior.
// /// * `user_data`: A pointer that will be passed to `callback`.
// ///
// /// ## Remarks
// /// This overrides the relative system scale and relative speed scale hints.

/// and SDL will report continuous relative mouse motion even if the mouse is at the edge of the window.
