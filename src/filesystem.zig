/// Finds the most suitable user folder for a specific purpose.
///
/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `folder`: The type of folder to find.
///
/// ## Return Value
/// Returns a full path to the folder requested.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// Many OSes provide certain standard folders for certain purposes, such as storing pictures, music or videos for a certain user.
/// This function gives the path for many of those special locations.
///
/// This function is specifically for user folders, which are meant for the user to access and manage.
/// For application-specific folders, meant to hold data for the application to manage, see `filesystem.getBasePath()` and `filesystem.getPrefPath()`.
///
/// The returned path is guaranteed to end with a path separator ('\' on Windows, '/' on most other platforms).
///

/// This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.

/// Enumerate a directory tree, filtered by pattern, and return a list.
///
/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `path`: The path of the directory to enumerate.
/// * `pattern`: The pattern that files in the directory must match. Can be `null`.
/// * `flags`: Flags to effect the search.
///
/// ## Return Value
/// Returns a slice of strings on success.
/// This should be freed with `free()`
///
/// ## Remarks
/// Files are filtered out if they don't match the string in pattern, which may contain wildcard characters '*' (match everything) and '?' (match one character).
/// If pattern is `null`, no filtering is done and all results are returned.
/// Subdirectories are permitted, and are specified with a path separator of '/'.
/// Wildcard characters '*' and '?' never match a path separator.
///
/// The `flags` may have `case_insensitive` to `true` to make the pattern matching case-insensitive.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// It is safe to call this function from any thread.
///

/// This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.

/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `old_path`: The old path.

///
/// ## Remarks
/// If the file at `new_path` already exists, it will replaced.
///
/// Note that this will not copy files across filesystems/drives/volumes, as that is a much more complicated (and possibly time-consuming) operation.
///
/// Which is to say, if this function fails, `filesystem.copyFile()` to a temporary file in the same directory as `new_path`,
/// then `filesystem.renamePath()` from the temporary file to `new_path` and `filesystem.remove_path()` on `old_path` might work for files.
/// Renaming a non-empty directory across filesystems is dramatically more complex, however.
