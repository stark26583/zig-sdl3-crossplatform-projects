///

/// * `spec`: The current format of audio that is to be submitted to the audio device.
/// * `buffer`: The buffer of audio samples to be submitted. The callback can inspect and/or modify this data.
/// * `buffer_len`: The size of `buffer` in bytes.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// This is useful for accessing the final mix,
/// perhaps for writing a visualizer or applying a final effect to the audio data before playback.
///
/// This callback should run as quickly as possible and not block for any significant time,
/// as this callback delays submission of data to the audio device, which can cause audio playback problems.
///
/// The postmix callback must be able to handle any audio data format specified in spec,
/// which can change between callbacks if the audio device changed.
/// However, this only covers frequency and channel count; data is always provided here in `audio.Format.floating_32_bit` format.
///
/// The postmix callback runs after logical device gain and audiostream gain have been applied,
/// which is to say you can make the output data louder at this point than the gain settings would suggest.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// This will run from a background thread owned by SDL.

/// * `additional_amount`: The amount of data, in bytes, that is needed right now.
/// * `total_amount`: The total amount of data requested, in bytes, that is requested or available.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// Apps can (optionally) register a callback with an audio stream that is called when data is added with
/// `audio.Stream.putData()`, or requested with `audio.Stream.getData()`.
///
/// Two values are offered here: one is the amount of additional data needed to satisfy the immediate request
/// (which might be zero if the stream already has enough data queued) and the other is the total amount being requested.
/// In a Get call triggering a Put callback, these values can be different.
/// In a Put call triggering a Get callback, these values are always the same.
///

///
/// This callback is not required to do anything.
/// Generally this is useful for adding/reading data on demand, and the app will often put/get data as appropriate,
/// but the system goes on with the data currently available to it if this callback does nothing.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// This callbacks may run from any thread, so if you need to protect shared data,
/// you should use `Stream.lock()` to serialize access; this lock will be held before your callback is called,
/// so your callback does not need to manage the lock explicitly.

    /// Playback devices will take data from bound audio streams, mix it, and send it to the hardware.

    /// An opened audio device starts out with no audio streams bound.

    /// Unlike SDL2, there is no audio callback; you only bind audio streams and make sure they have data flowing into them
    /// (however, you can simulate SDL2's semantics fairly closely by using `audio.Device.openStream()` instead of this function).
    ///
    /// If you don't care about opening a specific device, pass a devid of either `audio.Device.default_playback` or `audio.Device.default_recording`.
    /// In this case, SDL will try to pick the most reasonable default, and may also switch between physical devices seamlessly later,
    /// if the most reasonable default changes during the lifetime of this opened device (user changed the default in the OS's system preferences,
    /// the default got unplugged so the system jumped to a new default, the user plugged in headphones on a mobile device, etc).
    /// Unless you have a good reason to choose a specific device, this is probably what you want.
    ///
    /// You may request a specific format for the audio device, but there is no promise the device will honor that request for several reasons.
    /// As such, it's only meant to be a hint as to what data your app will provide.
    /// Audio streams will accept data in whatever format you specify and manage conversion for you as appropriate.
    /// `audio.Device.getFormat()` can tell you the preferred format for the device before opening and the actual format the device is using after opening.
    ///
    /// It's legal to open the same device ID more than once; each successful open will generate a new logical `audio.Device` that is managed separately
    /// from others on the same physical device.
    /// This allows libraries to open a device separately from the main app and bind its own streams without conflicting.
    ///
    /// It is also legal to open a device ID returned by a previous call to this function; doing so just creates another logical device on the same physical device.
    /// This may be useful for making logical groupings of audio streams.
    ///
    /// This function returns the opened device ID on success.
    /// This is a new, unique `audio.Device` that represents a logical device.
    ///
    /// Some backends might offer arbitrary devices (for example, a networked audio protocol that can connect to an arbitrary server).
    /// For these, as a change from SDL2, you should open a default device ID and use an SDL hint to specify the target if you care,
    /// or otherwise let the backend figure out a reasonable default.

    /// * `callback`: The new callback function to call when data is added to the stream.
    /// * `user_data`: An opaque pointer provided to the callback for its own personal use.

    /// This value might be less than what is currently available in the stream, if data was already there,
    /// and might be less than the caller provided if the stream needs to keep a buffer to aid in resampling.
    /// Which means the callback may be provided with zero bytes, and a different amount on each call.

    /// The callback may call `audio.Stream.getAvailable()` to see the total amount currently available to read from the stream,
    /// instead of the total provided by the current call.
