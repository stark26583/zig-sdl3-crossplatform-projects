/// Load an image from a filesystem path into a software surface.
///
/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `path`: A path on the filesystem to load an image from.
///
/// ## Return Value
/// Returns a new SDL surface.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// An surface is a buffer of pixels in memory accessible by the CPU.
/// Use this if you plan to hand the data to something else or manipulate it further in code.
///
/// There are no guarantees about what format the new surface data will be; in many cases, SDL image will attempt to supply a surface that exactly matches the provided image,
/// but in others it might have to convert (either because the image is in a format that SDL doesn't directly support or because it's compressed data that could reasonably
/// uncompress to various formats and SDL image had to pick one).
/// You can inspect an SDL Surface for its specifics, and use `surface.Surface.convert()` to then migrate to any supported format.
///
/// If the image format supports a transparent pixel, SDL will set the colorkey for the surface.
/// You can enable RLE acceleration on the surface afterwards by calling: `surface.Surface.setColorKey(image, image.getFormat().color_key);`
///
/// There is a separate function to read files from an SDL IO stream, if you need an i/o abstraction to provide data from anywhere instead of a simple filesystem read;
/// that function is `loadIo()`.
///
/// If you are using SDL's 2D rendering API, there is an equivalent call to load images directly into a `render.Texture` for use by the GPU
/// without using a software surface: call `image.loadTexture()` instead.
///
/// When done with the returned surface, the app should dispose of it with a call to `surface.Surface.deinit()`.
///
/// ## Version
/// This function is available since SDL image 3.0.0.

///
/// ## Function Parameters
