/// and the library isn't actually unloaded until there have been an equivalent number of calls to `vulkan.unloadLibrary()`.
///
/// It is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with libvulkan instead of explicitly loading it at run time.
/// This will work with SDL provided the application links to a dynamic library and both it and SDL use the same search path.
///
/// If you specify a non-null path, an application should retrieve all of the Vulkan functions it uses from the dynamic library using `vulkan.getVkGetInstanceProcAddr`
/// unless you can guarantee path points to the same vulkan loader library the application linked to.
///
/// On Apple devices, if path is `null`, SDL will attempt to find the `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` address within all the Mach-O images of the current process.
/// This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with `libvulkan` (and historically MoltenVK was provided as a static library).
/// If it is not found, on macOS, SDL will attempt to load `vulkan.framework/vulkan`, `libvulkan.1.dylib`, `MoltenVK.framework/MoltenVK`, and `libMoltenVK.dylib`, in that order.
/// On iOS, SDL will attempt to load `libMoltenVK.dylib`.
/// Applications using a dynamic framework or `.dylib` must ensure it is included in its application bundle.
///
/// On non-Apple devices, application linking with a static `libvulkan` is not supported.
