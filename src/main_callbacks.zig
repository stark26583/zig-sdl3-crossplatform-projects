/// This will be called once before anything else.
/// The argc/argv work like they always do.
/// If this returns `sdl3.AppResult.run`, the app runs.
/// If it returns `sdl3.AppResult.failure`, the app calls `SDL_AppQuit()` and terminates with an exit code that reports an error to the platform.
/// If it returns `sdl3.AppResult.success`, the app calls `SDL_AppQuit()` and terminates with an exit code that reports success to the platform.
/// This function should not go into an infinite mainloop; it should do any one-time startup it requires and then return.
///
/// If you want to, you can assign a pointer to `app_state`, and this pointer will be made available to you in later functions calls in their appstate parameter.
/// This allows you to avoid global variables, but is totally optional.
/// If you don't set this, the pointer will be `null` in later function calls.
///
/// App-implemented initial entry point for main callback apps.
///
/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `app_state`: A place where the app can optionally store a pointer for future use.
/// * `arg_count`: The standard ANSI C main's argc; number of elements in `arg_values`.
/// * `arg_values`: The standard ANSI C main's argv; array of command line arguments.
///
/// ## Return Value
/// Returns `sdl3.AppResult.failure` to terminate with an error, `sdl3.AppResult.success` to terminate with success, `sdl3.AppResult.run` to continue.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// Apps implement this function when using main callbacks.
/// If using a standard "main" function, you should not supply this.
///
/// This function is called by SDL once, at startup.
/// The function should initialize whatever is necessary, possibly create windows and open audio devices, etc.
/// The argc and argv parameters work like they would with a standard "main" function.
///
/// This function should not go into an infinite mainloop; it should do any one-time setup it requires and then return.
///
/// The app may optionally assign a pointer to `app_state`.
/// This pointer will be provided on every future call to the other entry points,
/// to allow application state to be preserved between functions without the app needing to use a global variable.
/// If this isn't set, the pointer will be `null` in future entry points.
///
/// If this function returns `sdl3.AppResult.run`, the app will proceed to normal operation,
/// and will begin receiving repeated calls to `SDL_AppIterate()` and `SDL_AppEvent()` for the life of the program.
/// If this function returns `sdl3.AppResult.failure`,
/// SDL will call `SDL_AppQuit()` and terminate the process with an exit code that reports an error to the platform.
/// If it returns `sdl3.AppResult.success`, SDL calls `SDL_AppQuit()` and terminates with an exit code that reports success to the platform.
///
/// This function is called by SDL on the main thread.
///
/// ## Version
/// This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
