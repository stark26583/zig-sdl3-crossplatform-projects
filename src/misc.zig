/// Open a URL/URI in the browser or other appropriate external application.
///
/// ## Function Parameters
/// * `url`: A valid URL/URI to open. Use file:///full/path/to/file for local files, if supported.
///
/// ## Remarks
/// Open a URL in a separate, system-provided application.
/// How this works will vary wildly depending on the platform.
/// This will likely launch what makes sense to handle a specific URL's protocol (a web browser for http://, etc),
/// but it might also be able to launch file managers for directories and other things.
///
/// What happens when you open a URL varies wildly as well:
/// your game window may lose focus (and may or may not lose focus if your game was fullscreen or grabbing input at the time).
/// On mobile devices, your app will likely move to the background or your process might be paused.
/// Any given platform may or may not handle a given URL.
///
/// If this is unimplemented (or simply unavailable) for a platform, this will fail with an error.
/// A successful result does not mean the URL loaded, just that we launched something to handle it (or at least believe we did).
///
/// All this to say: this function can be useful, but you should definitely test it on every platform you target.
///
/// ## Version
/// This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
